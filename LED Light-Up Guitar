LED Light-Up Guitar
Idea by: Kyle @tobiasyoda

Summary/Features: 
An electric guitar that has LED lights on the front of the body that light up according to which notes and rhythms are played on the guitar.

Skills/Materials/Tools needed:
-Electric wiring
-Programming: computer-activated lighting
-Signal translation
-Electric guitar
-Raspberry Pi

Description:
I once saw a rock concert where the drummer had a drum set made out of a transparent material. There were lights
attached to the drumms that would light up and shine through the set. It looked pretty cool. 

After seeing the design of a transparent electric guitar made out of lucite, I thought it might look pretty sweet to apply the same idea from the drum set I saw to the lucite guitar. 

Colored LED lights would be attached to the front of the guitar. Then different lights would be activated in various
patterns depending on what note was played a which octave, and at the same rate as the notes were played. The power
supply to the lights would be separate from the mechanism that actually switched them on and off. I was thinking that that mechanism would be a Raspberry Pi. 

I have an electric guitar I can donate to the cause, and I can buy LEDs and a Raspberry Pi. 

Cons: 
This project requires ample dedication to hardware as much as softeware. It may be that programming the lights will be simple, but translating the sonic signal from a guitar string to the pickup (electric) to the computer may prove the difficult part. Basically translating from sound wave to electric signal into a computer may be the hardest part.
